            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The cardboard laptop was created by Tomi as a fun project to enhance making skills using an old laptop. The project aimed to explore creative and practical applications of cardboard crafting.</p>

            <h2>Materials Used</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cardboard</strong>: Primary material for the body of the laptop.</li>
                <li><strong>Hot Glue</strong>: Used for assembling the cardboard components.</li>
                <li><strong>Toothpicks</strong>: Employed in structural reinforcement.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Design</h2>
            <p>The design of the laptop was improvised rather than based on a specific blueprint. The laptop currently does not include a screen or keyboard but may have these components added in the future.</p>

            <h2>Dimensions</h2>
            <p>The current design includes only the motherboard and battery. No specific dimensions were defined, as the focus was on creating the laptop's body and housing the internal components.</p>

            <h2>Assembly Process</h2>
            <p>The laptop was assembled in approximately two days. The process involved crafting the body from cardboard, attaching the motherboard and battery, and ensuring functionality. No significant challenges were encountered during the assembly.</p>

            <h2>Functional Elements</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The laptop includes the motherboard and ports.</li>
                <li>It allows for the insertion and removal of a storage device (HDD/SSD).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Final Outcome</h2>
            <p>The laptop is entirely made of cardboard. The design showcases a unique and imaginative use of materials but does not yet include interactive components like a screen or keyboard.</p>

            <h2>Future Improvements</h2>
            <p>Plans include adding a keyboard and possibly a mouse to enhance functionality and usability.</p>

            <h2>Creator</h2>
            <p><strong>Name</strong>: Tomi</p>
